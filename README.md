# Binary files - Notebooks

This project is meant to keep some notes about binaries, executables and compilation.
Notes are written in notebooks. A `requirements.txt file is available to set up a python3 environment.

Environment can be setup the following way :

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the environment setup, you should be able to start JupyterLab by running `jupyter lab` at the root of the repo.
